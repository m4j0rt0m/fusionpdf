# FusionPDF

FusionPDF is a lightweight command-line tool designed to blend and overlay two PDF files into a single polished output. Whether youâ€™re creating composite documents, overlays, or simply combining pages with precision, FusionPDF makes it simple and efficient.

## Features

- **Blend PDF Pages**: Combines the first pages of two PDF files into a visually appealing overlay.
- **Normalization**: Automatically adjusts output for optimal results.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and fast execution.
- **Command-Line Simplicity**: Run directly from the terminal with clear and concise options.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

FusionPDF requires the following tools:
- **ImageMagick**: For image processing.
- **Poppler-utils**: For extracting images from PDFs.

Install them with:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install imagemagick poppler-utils
```

### Install FusionPDF

Clone the repository and use the script directly:

```
git clone https://github.com/m4j0rt0m/fusionpdf.git
cd fusionpdf
chmod +x fusionpdf
sudo cp fusionpdf /usr/local/bin/
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```
fusionpdf <input1.pdf> <input2.pdf> <output.pdf>
```

### Examples

1. Combine two PDFs:
```
fusionpdf front.pdf back.pdf result.pdf
```
2. Overlay and save to a specific path:
```
fusionpdf cover.pdf watermark.pdf ~/Documents/combined.pdf
```

> If you omit any required argument, the tool will display usage instructions.

## How It Works

1. Extracts Images: Takes the first pages of both PDFs and converts them to images.
2. Blends Images: Combines the images using transparency and normalization for optimal results.
3. Creates PDF: Converts the blended image back into a PDF.

## Troubleshooting

### i) `convert: attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy 'PDF'`

**Cause**: This error occurs because ImageMagick's default security policy restricts PDF operations.

**Solution**:
1. Locate the `policy.xml` file:
```bash
locate policy.xml | grep ImageMagick
```
>Common locations:
>* /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
>* /usr/lib/ImageMagick-6.9.10/config-Q16/policy.xml

2. Edit the file with a text editor:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
```

3. Find the line restricting PDF operations:
```xml
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
```

4. Change `rights="none"` to `rights="read|write"`:
```xml
<policy domain="coder" rights="read|write" pattern="PDF" />
```

5. Save the policy file, restart your terminal and try again, it should be solved.
